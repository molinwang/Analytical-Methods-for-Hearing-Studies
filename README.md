# Methods for analyzing audiometric data


The commonly-used worse-ear and better-ear methods may lead to biased estimates, and the left/right ear method typically results in less-efficient estimates. In certain settings, the both-ear method using the Generalized Estimating Equation approach for analyses of audiometric data may be preferable to the single-ear methods.
